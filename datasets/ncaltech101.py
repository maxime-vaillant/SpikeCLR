    This class extends NCALTECH101 to support train/test splits, loading only
    the data for the current split.

    Parameters:
        save_to (string): Location to save files to on disk.
        train (bool): If True, creates dataset from training set, otherwise from test set.
        split_ratio (float): Ratio of data to use for training (default: 0.9).
        transform (callable, optional): A callable of transforms to apply to the data.
        target_transform (callable, optional): A callable of transforms to apply to the targets/labels.
        transforms (callable, optional): A callable of transforms that is applied to both data and labels.
